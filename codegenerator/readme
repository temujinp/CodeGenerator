Code Generator works exclusively on a MySql database.

Currently it only generates .java file for each table in the database.
It produces all the code in-line but should rather later use a template 
in the format of a text file whereupon character replacements 
can be done for flexibility and easy human readability.

This wull be phase 2 once I've gotten the basics complete.
